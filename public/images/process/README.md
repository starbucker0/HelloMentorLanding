# Process Screenshots

This folder should contain 5 portrait screenshots of your HelloMentor app process:

## Required Screenshots (640x1280px or similar, portrait orientation):

1. **step1-profile.jpg** - Profile setup screen showing user creating their profile
2. **step2-matching.png** - AI matching interface showing mentor suggestions
3. **step3-sessions.png** - Mentorship session interface with AI-suggested frameworks
4. **step4-progress.png** - Progress tracking dashboard with goals and metrics
5. **step5-community.png** - Community features with group challenges and reflections

## Screenshot Guidelines:
- **Orientation**: Portrait (vertical) format - like mobile app screenshots
- **Resolution**: 640x1280px (1:2 aspect ratio) or similar portrait dimensions
- **Format**: PNG or JPG
- **Content**: Clean, professional mobile UI showing the key features
- **Text**: Ensure any text in screenshots is readable

## Placeholder Images:
Until you add your actual screenshots, the images will show as broken links. You can:
1. Add your real app screenshots with the exact filenames above
2. Use placeholder images from services like:
   - https://picsum.photos/450/800 (for temporary placeholders)
   - Create mobile mockups using tools like Figma or Sketch

## Tips for Great Mobile Screenshots:
- Use consistent mobile styling across all screenshots
- Show realistic data/content (not Lorem ipsum)
- Highlight the key feature being described in each step
- Consider adding subtle highlights or annotations to guide the viewer's eye
- Screenshots should look like they're from a mobile app interface
